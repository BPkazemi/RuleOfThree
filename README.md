# The Rule of Three
A simple web app to ask yourself three questions a day - 
1) What inspired you today?
2) What motivated you today?
3) What surprised you today?

# Why do I need this?

Because life is better when you reflect.

# Cool! How'd you do it?

Using Angular.js, Node, and Mongodb! A great excuse to use all three =)
